## About

**Expose all the knobs  |⸰| As lean as a racehorse can get |⸰| Fork and keep as an upstream, then create your own endpoints**

The skeleton-tgr-app-express is an express server that loads a React App. This skeleton demonstrates building a server and client in a single 'fullstack' repo. This is especially useful for developing horizontally scaling webservices with Docker. It is a combination of the work done in a react-app skeleton and an express-endpoint skeleton.

**The point of view prioritized is app development with very rare changes to anything outside**

1) the express service is based on [typescript-apollo-endpoint](https://github.com/TGRstack/typescript-apollo-endpoint)
2) the react app is based on [typescript-graphql-react-app](https://github.com/TGRstack/typescript-graphql-react-app)
3) webpack compiles the app and server, and then express serves the app
4) the server and app are similarly structured with a `stack.ts`, `config`, and `middleware`

## TGR Packages (npm - @tgrx)

```bash
  "dependencies": {
    "@tgrx/apollo-link-state": "0.4.3",
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tgrx/tslint-config-tgr": "5.0.0", # TGR tslint settings for minimial clutter
  }
```

## Upgrading your Skeleton from an upstream

[Github Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/)

### Initial Setup

1) First, clone this repo to your local machine
2) Change the remote name `git remote rename origin upstream`
3) Create a new repository in github/gitlab
4) Add the new remote `git remote add origin <your-new-address>`

### Usage

When updates for the upstream are available, merge them into your skeleton

```bash
git pull upstream master
# Handle merge conflicts if necessary
git commit # commit the changes if necessary
git push origin master
```

## Developing a TS-Service

After you've cloned this repo and ran `npm i -D`, do the following:

in your **terminal**:

```bash
$ nps
# Starts the development environment w/ watch-rebuilds for client & server
```

## Commands - READ THIS

Check out the shortcuts at `/scripts/shortcuts.js` like `nps lf` or `nps c`

```bash
* nps                   # Executes the module, watching for rebuilds.
* nps help              # Displays all available commands
* nps commit            # Creates a commit, don't use `git commit -m ...`
* nps build             # Builds the module
* nps lint              # Lint checks the module
* nps test              # Test checks the module
```

### Utils

- [x] 🎮  `nps` npm scripts w/o a bloated package.json and limits of json [docs: NPS](#docs-nps).

- [x] 😹  `cz-emoji` is a plugin for commitizen that adds emoji to the commit template.
- [x] 🏆  `standard-version` is a replacement for `npm version` with automatic CHANGELOG generation
- [ ] ✅  `commitlint` validates commit messages to follow commitizen patterns

## Getting started

To use the starter-kit to build your own ts-module run these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TGRstack/typescript-graphql-react-app-express my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git && git init
# nps c # for nps commit instead of running git commit
git commit -m "INIT'd w/ TGRstack/typescript-graphql-react-app-express@SHA4985"
npm install
nps test
nps
```

Open package.json and reset following fields:

```text
- name
- version ( It is recommended to start from 1.0.0 )
- description
- repository.url
- author
- license ( use whatever you want )
```

Now go make some changes to `src/app/index.ts` to see the tooling in action.

- [Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md)

### docs-dotenv

Webpack is configured to use a DotEnv plugin and uses DotEnv files in specific ways.

1. Everything in `.env.example` is considered a required .env field (compiler complains)
2. `.env.development` will be used if `.env` is missing
3. In production just use .env, this is ignored by git (as it should be!)

### docs-module-aliases

Module aliases are defined in 2 places because of an issue w/ [tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/dividab/tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin/issues/34)

- Aliasing for typescript, ts-node, ts-jest, the IDE are defined in `tsconfig.json` as expected.
- Since the webpack plugin isn't working, aliases are duplicated in `./webpack/config.js`.

**Any changes to one requires a change to the other!**

### docs-nps

`node-package-scripts` removes the limitation of package.json enabling Javascript and //comments. 

To change scripts modify `/scripts/` and use `nps <command>` instead of `npm run <command>`.
The entry point for nps is `./package-scripts.js` which routes to `scripts/index.js` which routes to the friendlier `scripts/__index.js`.

# FAQ

## Where are all the files in my IDE?

You must be using vscode! I have configured vscode workspace settings to hide everything from the filebrowser that you're unlikely to touch in day-to-day development.

Many files are still accessible through search (ctrl+p), such as the `./vscode/settings.json` file where you can comment/uncomment my decisions and make everything your own.

P.S. you may like the tgrstack snippets extension since its formatted following the linting preferneces here.
